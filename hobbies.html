                <h3>MK 7.5 Golf GTD</h3>
                <p>A German hothatch I hope to own in the near future as this car no longer is manufactured, hence it is
                    discontinued due to emmissions making us switch to electric cars!</p>

                <h3>Nismo GTR</h3>
                <p>The Nissan Skyline GT-R R34 remains a highly sought-after collector's car due to its impressive
                    performance and its reputation as one of the best Japanese sports cars of its era. Its legacy
                    has continued to influence the automotive world and popular culture.</p>

                <h3>Toyota Supra</h3>
                <p>This Toyota Supra was featured in the first ever Fast & Furious Movie. Paul Walker loved it so much
                    he begged the director to keep it. </p>

                <h3>Microsoft</h3>
                <p>Microsoft is a global technology leader, founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. Known for its
                    software, including Windows OS and Microsoft Office, it also develops hardware and cloud services.
                    Microsoft has become a major player in personal computing,
                    gaming, and enterprise solutions. I hope to work at the top leading tech firm sometime in the
                    future.
